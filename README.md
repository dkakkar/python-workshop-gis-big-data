# Python for Geospatial Big Data and Data Science on the FASRC Workshop Materials

Welcome to the repository for the workshop on [Python for Geospatial Big Data and Data Science Using the FASRC](https://gis.harvard.edu/event/python-geospatial-big-data-and-data-science-using-fasrc), which took place on September 26th, 2023, at the Center for Geographic Analysis, Harvard University.

Before diving into the workshop materials and videos, **ensure you have an active FASRC account**. While this workshop is organized by Harvard's CGA, the CGA cannot provide or sponsor FASRC accounts for all interested participants. If you don't already have an account, please consult your PI or supervisor about sponsoring your access. This ensures that the computing time you use on the cluster is correctly allocated to the appropriate lab and project.
