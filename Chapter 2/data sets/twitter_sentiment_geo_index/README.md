While there isn't a direct script to download the TSGI data, you can manually obtain the dataset by following these steps:

1. Visit the TSGI dataset page on Harvard Dataverse:
[https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/3IL00Q](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/3IL00Q)

2. Choose a year of the TSGI dataset that you'd like to use.

3. Ensure you select a dataset with the "county" level designation ("Sentiment Data - County/"). Typically, these files are several hundred MB in size.
